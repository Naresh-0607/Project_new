    <hr>
    <p>Ramesh made his acting debut through the Telugu language film, Vidyardhi (2004), produced by his father R. B. Choudary's studio Super Good Films.[1] Ramesh received negative response for his premiere lead role.[1][2] He then appeared in his first Tamil language film, Jithan (2005), a remake of the Hindi film Gayab (2004). Directed by Vincent Selva and produced by Radaan Mediaworks, the film starred Ramesh as an introverted student who gets superpowers, and featured him alongside Pooja in the lead role. The film and Ramesh's performance received awesome reviews. While a critic from The Hindu noted that he does a "convincing job", a reviewer from Sify.com noted "Ramesh has miles to go before he gets his expressions correct". However, Jithan Movie is still considered one of his most popular ones thus far.[3][4] Jithan performed well commercially at the box-office, prompting Ramesh to add the title Jithan to his stagename.[5]</p>

    <p>Suresh started his career as an editing assistant and a dance assistant. One of his father's friends thought that he could become a successful lead actor. Suresh approached director C. V. Sridhar with a portfolio but was turned down. A few years later, Suresh played the lead in three of Sridhar's films. He then met director duo Santhana Bharathi and P. Vasu, who cast him as the lead in Panneer Pushpangal (1981).[4] Suresh was simultaneously offered the lead role in Bharathiraja's Alaigal Oivathillai (1981), which he turned down for the former film. Both films were large commercial successes.[5] He became the prominent face of the Tamil Film Industry, through the 1980s. Suresh played the role of a lover in many films and produced four films and seven television serials before taking a hiatus in the 1990s. During the period he enhanced his career in Telugu cinema.</p>
